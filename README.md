## How it Works ?
1. Explaining the working of project
   In this game, the player controls a character that runs around the screen, automatically shooting at waves of approaching enemies (mobs). The goal is to survive as long as possible by dodging enemies and staying 
   on the move, while the character's shooting clears the path ahead. The gameplay is simple, focusing on continuous movement and automatic shooting to defeat as many mobs as possible.
2. Embed video of project demo
## Libraries used
Godot Engine: Version 4.3 (or latest stable version)
## How to configure
To configure this game, start by setting up a 2D game engine like Godot or Unity. Create a player character with basic movement controls and an automatic shooting mechanic that triggers at regular intervals. Design simple enemy (mob) sprites and set them to spawn in waves, moving toward the player. Implement collision detection to handle when the player's shots hit enemies and when enemies collide with the player. Finally, adjust game parameters like enemy spawn rate, player speed, and shooting frequency to balance difficulty, and test the game to ensure smooth gameplay.
## How to Run
To run the game, open the project in your game engine (like Godot or Unity) and click the "Play" button. This will start the game, allowing you to control the character and play. If it works well, you can save it as a playable file to share or use on other devices.
